Universal Game Translator

It's a pretty jank translation utility designed to work in two modes:

Desktop mode - Useful for games running in windows, webpages, or pictures. It can be controlled
by a gamepad as well.  Some gamepads (XBOX pads/etc) can be used to initiate a capture, even
while using the same pad to play the game.  (By default, clicking down on the right stick will do it)

Camera mode - Snaps pictures from an HDMI input.  Tested with
Elgato Game Capture and Elgato Cam-Link.  Camera mode is designed
to be controlled with a 360 controller.  B button to initiate a snap/translate, after
that you can use the left joystick to navigate over the settings icon in the bottom
right to get some help.

Before using this, you need to setup your Google account.  Edit the file config_template.txt 
for more directions.  (You'll need to rename it config.txt as well)
